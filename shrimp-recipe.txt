15 minutes inactive
Whisk together garlic, serrano, lime juice, zest, soy sauce, brown sugar and olive oil. Add shrimp and marinate for 15 minutes. No more than that, because the acid will start to cook the shrimp.
On a grill or in a hot skillet, sear the shrimp, 1–2 minutes on each side until just cooked through.
Transfer the hot shrimp to a plate and garnish with a bit of chopped cilantro and squeeze of fresh lime. Serve with the roasted poblano cream.
Roasted poblano cream
Place oil in skillet over high heat. Roast the poblano and garlic cloves until charred and blistered, turning every couple minutes. For the garlic cloves, this will take about 5 minutes and the poblano an additional 15 minutes. Let the poblano cool a bit before removing the charred exterior and the seeds.
In a saucepan, warm the cream with the spices. Carefully puree the roasted poblano and garlic cloves with the warm cream in a food processor. Return this to the pan and cook until thickened, about 7 minutes. Salt to taste and whisk in fresh lime juice.
Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Will keep covered in the refrigerator for 1 week.
